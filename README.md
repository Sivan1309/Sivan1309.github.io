# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Technical Portfolio Repository

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains my cybersecurity master’s coursework transformed into practical, engaging technical security content. Instead of publishing traditional academic reports, I have converted my learning, research, and hands-on projects into readable blog-style security write-ups designed for real-world relevance and professional review.

The goal is to present applied cybersecurity knowledge — not theory alone — through structured, practitioner-oriented content.

This repository demonstrates how I translate academic foundations into operational security insight, technical analysis, and business-aligned security thinking.
