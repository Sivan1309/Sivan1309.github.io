Title: "Critical Infrastructure Defense: Zero Trust Mitigation of Unauthenticated Windows RPC Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-26809)"
Date: 2/9/2024

## Problem: Unauthenticated Remote Compromise and Total Loss of Business Availability

I tackled CVE-2022-26809, a critical security vulnerability residing within the core Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) runtime, which powers internal communication across the Windows ecosystem. This flaw was assigned a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8, signaling extreme danger.

**The Technical Challenge (The How):** This vulnerability allowed an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted RPC call over the network to a vulnerable host, leading directly to Remote Code Execution (RCE) with the privileges of the hosting RPC service. Critically, this attack requires no user interaction. Since this attack can originate from outside the network, it serves as a primary network breach vector.

**The Business Imperative (The Why):** A successful RCE exploit results in the total compromise of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). The organization faced severe consequences: total loss of confidentiality (all resources divulged), total loss of integrity (attacker modifying any critical files), and total loss of availability (denying access to resources sustainedly or persistently). This vulnerability was a launchpad for devastating attacks like lateral movement and privilege escalation across systems, including Windows Server 2022, Windows 11, and others. My objective was to eliminate this systemic risk and ensure core business continuity.

## My Solution: Architecting Low-Level Defense and Threat Detection

I engineered a robust defense by dissecting the underlying RPC mechanisms, performing root cause analysis on the integer overflow, and implementing a multi-layered security architecture, thus framing my capabilities in Vulnerability Research, Zero Trust Architecture Design, and Advanced SIEM Engineering.

### 1. Advanced Vulnerability Root Cause Analysis

I focused on the technical core of the vulnerability, which resides in the Windows RPC runtime library, `rpcrt4.dll`.

**The Flaw: Integer Overflow Leading to Heap Buffer Overflow**

> The root vulnerability was an integer overflow bug embedded in the RPC runtime code. This overflow allowed calculated values to exceed their defined capacity. This technical failure then triggered a heap buffer overflow, a critical condition where data is written beyond the allocated memory boundaries of a buffer on the heap. This out-of-bounds write is the mechanism that allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary remote code over the network without authentication.



### Dissecting the RPC Communication Workflow

To fully understand the flaw, I analyzed the behind-the-scenes RPC workflow and the key components involved:

* **Endpoint Mapper:** Acts as a directory service for RPC programs. When a client application tries to access a remote service, it first sends a request to the endpoint mapper. The endpoint mapper looks up the service's registered UUID and provides the client with the network address (endpoint) of the server hosting the service.

* **SVCCTL service (`svchost.exe`):** This is a generic service host in Windows. Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` can exist, each hosting a group of related services. It is responsible for loading the necessary DLLs for the hosted services and managing their lifecycles.

* **Service-Specific DLL (e.g., OpenSCManager):** This is a dynamic-link library (DLL) containing the actual implementation of a service, like one for managing smart cards. Once the client receives the endpoint from the endpoint mapper, it sends the RPC request directly to the `svchost.exe` instance hosting the target service.

* **`Rpcrt4.dll`:** This is the core Windows DLL providing low-level RPC runtime support. It handles critical tasks like marshalling (packing parameters into a network message) and unmarshalling (unpacking them), serializing requests and responses, and managing the underlying network communication.

**RPC workflow (client-server model):**

* **Client Stub:** Initiates the call and performs marshalling (packing procedure parameters into a network message).
* **Server Stub:** Receives the packets from the server OS and performs unmarshalling (unpacking the parameters from the message).
* **Core Functions in `rpcrt4.dll`:** The vulnerability existed in functions responsible for data processing, such as:
    * **Server-Side:** `OSF_SCALL:ProcessReceivedPDU` (handles unpacking and interpreting incoming RPC requests) and `OSF_SCALL:GetCoalescedBuffer` (retrieves a buffer, where the heap overflow happens).

**Patch Analysis and Validation (Security Engineering Capability)**

I reverse-engineered the vendor patch to confirm the security fix. The mitigation involved adding a new call to `ProcessReceivedPdu` server-side function in the patched version of rpcrt4.dll.

<img width="1323" height="457" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af3682a-2823-4abf-a59b-a7477d20fdf7" />

This call triggers an explicit integer overflow validation checks within the critical server-side function, `ProcessReceivedPDU`. 

<img width="1513" height="516" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313da729-2b3c-4ab3-bf8f-b3ba6de3a99f" />

This check verifies that an integer parameter remains within the expected value range, effectively preventing the overflow condition.

Similar overflow checks were strategically implemented in other critical functions on both the server-side (`OSF_SCALL:GetCoalescedBuffer`) and client-side (`OSF_CCALL:ProcessResponse`, `OSF_CCALL:GetCoalescedBuffer`) execution paths, ensuring comprehensive protection.

### 2. Developing Granular Detection Architectures

I implemented a robust, multi-phased detection strategy aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Phase 1 & 2: Forensic and Protocol Analysis**

I focused initial detection efforts on Windows Event Manager RPC logs, specifically monitoring for Event ID 5712, which confirms an attempted RPC call. This log data captures crucial identifying information, including the Interface UUID.

<img width="813" height="1051" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293af85e-41c7-4eb5-94ad-76d9ff89d023" />

To enable rapid threat hunting, I leveraged RPC View, a specialized, cost-free tool designed to examine and deconstruct RPC features within the system. This allows security teams to use the Interface UUID (a 128-bit unique fingerprint for each RPC interface) and endpoint mapper information to pinpoint malicious activity.

<img width="1409" height="1060" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd445d9-767e-49bf-bc79-f9d86aa505d1" />

<img width="1007" height="844" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cbe0584-da0c-4483-8305-cf542309bd52" />


**Phase 3: Targeted RPC Filtering (Security Control Expertise)**

I implemented advanced security controls by creating RPC filtering rules based on UUIDs.
* **Mechanism:** UUIDs serve as distinctive fingerprints for RPC interfaces. By creating rules targeting specific UUIDs, access control gains a finer level of granularity than traditional port or protocol filtering.

<img width="1276" height="304" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad8bb1f-944f-468b-b41e-5fb35d13d7da" />

* **Value:** This allows teams to block access only to interfaces known to be vulnerable or unnecessary, drastically minimizing the attack surface for RCE exploits without blocking legitimate business communications. This demonstrated my ability to deliver surgical security control.

**Advanced Detection: SIEM Engineering and MITRE Alignment**

I designed and implemented detection logic within the Elastic Stack (ELK) SIEM solution, combining Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, to visualize and analyze security data in real-time.

<img width="1388" height="271" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be1363ff-d49d-4b4d-be9e-384de49bbacc" />

* **MITRE Alignment:** I mapped the threat to the attackerâ€™s progression:
    * **Tactic ID TA0001 (Initial Access):** This involved techniques where adversaries gain a foothold.
    * **Technique ID T1190 (Exploit Public Facing Application):** This technique specifically describes adversaries exploiting public-facing standard services like RPC.

    <img width="1179" height="786" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7faba42-d650-4731-99b0-3c54295ebf23" />

* **Elastic Rule Implementation:** I wrote a specific rule designed to catch RPC traffic originating from external, non-internal IP addresses. The rule specifically targets network traffic flows using the TCP transport layer and looking for common RPC ports (`destination.port:135`) or DCE/RPC datasets (`event.dataset:zeek.dce_rpc`).

<img width="1064" height="1185" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe86dd3-9375-4838-9e21-988340d2b71a" />


* **Business Impact:** This SIEM architecture ensures that when a rule matches forwarded logs, an alert is triggered via PagerDuty, allowing the System Admin to recognize the malicious RPC call and raise an incident within Service Level Agreement (SLA) timeframes, ensuring business continuity.

### 3. Strategic Mitigation and Zero Trust Deployment

The mitigation strategy accounted for both the high-likelihood server-side threat and the less-likely but critical client-side threat (where clients are tricked into connecting to a malicious server).

**Initial Mitigation: Enforcing Zero Trust Network Segmentation**

I recommended mandatory network segmentation as the foundation of a Zero Trust security model.
* **Technical Implementation:** This restricts RPC and SMB communications between workstation and server subnets to the extent possible. For instance, limiting SMB (TCP 445) communication only to the domain controller is necessary for enforcing secure, necessary communications.

**Server-Side Defense: Host-Based Firewall Capabilities**

I confirmed that Host-based firewalls effectively block inbound RPC communications over TCP port 135. However, I addressed the technical caveats that named pipes could still be exploited over TCP 445 (SMB), and an attacker might exploit an RPC service listening on an ephemeral port. Therefore, adhering to "deny all, permit by exception" Zero Trust principles is the best defensive strategy.

**Client-Side Defense: Egress Filtering**

To address client-side vulnerabilities, I implemented the requirement for egress firewall configuration.
* **Mechanism:** Blocking outbound traffic on standard Microsoft RPC ports (like TCP 135 and 445) at the service edge prevents a user or application from being "tricked" through a phishing delivery into initiating an connection to a rogue external RPC server.

**Futuristic Approach: Cyber Deception**

Acknowledging that millions of MSRPC services are publicly exposed on ports 135 and 445, I proposed integrating cyber deception techniques. Deploying decoys (honeypots) confuses threat actors, minimizes actual system alarms, and yields valuable real-time intelligence on adversary tactics, thus strengthening overall defense resilience by diverting attention from genuine assets.

## Impact: Quantifiable Risk Elimination and Demonstrated Expertise

This analysis and defense deployment directly secured mission-critical systems and enhanced the organization's defensive posture:
* **Risk Elimination:** By identifying and implementing the technical patches that specifically address the integer overflow in the RPC runtime, I eliminated the risk of unauthenticated remote code execution, securing systems like Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11.
* **Enhanced Security Posture:** The implementation of RPC filtering rules using UUIDs demonstrated a capability to apply granular, surgical security control, minimizing the attack surface far more effectively than traditional port blocking.
* **Improved Resilience:** The integration of the Elastic SIEM architecture, aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ensures that security teams can rapidly detect and isolate threats by triggering timely alerts, guaranteeing that system admins can raise incidents within established SLA windows, thereby protecting business continuity.

## Key Learnings: Mastering RPC Architecture

My most significant challenge involved establishing a deep comprehension of the underlying RPC workflow. Specifically, internalizing the complexities of how the client stub handles marshalling (packing parameters) and how the server stub handles unmarshalling (unpacking parameters) was crucial for understanding precisely where and why the integer overflow occurred within `rpcrt4.dll`.

By consciously approaching vulnerabilities from the standpoint of potential threat actors (adopting the attacker's mindset), I significantly advanced my knowledge of defensive architecture and strategic mitigation planning. This project confirmed that high-level security expertise requires balancing rigorous low-level analysis with proactive defense strategies to maintain a secure online environment.
