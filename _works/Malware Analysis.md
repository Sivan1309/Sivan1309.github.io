# Malware Under the Microscope: Hands-On Static, Dynamic & Reverse Engineering Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This project documents a hands-on malware research investigation covering static analysis, dynamic analysis, packed binary inspection, DLL behavioral analysis, and reverse engineering across multiple suspicious samples including PDFs, PE executables, and DLL files.

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world malware triage and research workflow — starting from file triage and structure inspection through behavioral execution, capability mapping, and MITRE ATT&CK alignment — using industry malware analysis tooling and controlled sandbox environments.

The outcome includes malicious sample confirmation, behavioral capability mapping, persistence discovery, network indicators, and reverse-engineered execution traits.

This project demonstrates applied skills in:

- Malware static & dynamic analysis
- Packed binary investigation
- PDF malware inspection
- DLL behavioral analysis
- Registry & persistence tracing
- Network traffic analysis
- Capability detection using CAPA
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Reverse engineering fundamentals

---

## Investigation Objective

The objective was not just classification — but **evidence-driven determination of malicious behavior** using:

- Static structure analysis
- Packed binary inspection
- Behavioral execution tracing
- Registry & persistence validation
- Network traffic analysis
- Capability mapping
- Reverse engineering verification

Every conclusion is supported by tool output evidence and analyst interpretation.

---

## Sample Scope

| Sample          | Type    | Investigation Focus                  |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| CW_sample1–3    | PDF     | Embedded script & execution triggers |
| suspicious.file | PE EXE  | Packed malware behavior              |
| malsample.dll   | DLL     | Persistence & service abuse          |

# Phase 1 — Malicious PDF Investigation

## Analyst Goal

Determine whether PDFs contain execution triggers or embedded scripts **without executing them**.

---

## Raw Structure Inspection

## Initial File Integrity — Hash Generation (PDF Samples)

Before starting the analysis, cryptographic hashes were generated for each PDF sample to create a unique fingerprint and preserve file integrity.

```bash
md5sum CW_sample1.pdf
md5sum CW_sample2.pdf
md5sum CW_sample3.pdf

sha256sum CW_sample1.pdf
sha256sum CW_sample2.pdf
sha256sum CW_sample3.pdf
````

### Why This Step Is Important

* Creates a unique and verifiable file identity
* Avoids accidental sample confusion
* Allows safe reputation checks via hash lookup
* Supports IOC documentation and reporting
* Aligns with standard malware analysis workflow

---

## VirusTotal Lookup — Reputation Verification

Instead of uploading the files, their hashes were queried in VirusTotal to check detection reputation safely.

### Observed Lab Results

| Sample         | Detection Count | Interpretation |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| CW_sample1.pdf | Low / None      | Likely benign  |
| CW_sample2.pdf | 47 vendors      | Malicious      |
| CW_sample3.pdf | 43 vendors      | Malicious      |

### Analyst Note

Detection ratios provide supporting signals, not definitive proof. Final conclusions were based on static file structure analysis and embedded behavior indicators.

---

**Tool:** SciTE
**Purpose:** Inspect encoded streams safely

<img width="652" height="1168" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761f49c1-b56d-4b9e-adea-ca8acfa2f8d5" />

**Observation**

Encoded object streams present → requires structural scanning.

**Decision:** Escalate to structural indicator scan.

---

## Structural Trigger Scan

**Tool:** PDFiD

```bash
pdfid.py CW_sample1.pdf
pdfid.py CW_sample2.pdf
pdfid.py CW_sample3.pdf
```

<img width="1762" height="1242" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e750f0fa-16b1-46a1-b229-a14e0199ac40" />

**Evidence**

* /JavaScript present
* /OpenAction present
* /AA present

---

## Phase 1.1 - Further Analysis with peepdf

peePDF was used after PDFiD to enumerate objects and detect hidden components.

**Launch peePDF**

```bash
peepdf CW_sample1.pdf
peepdf CW_sample2.pdf
peepdf CW_sample3.pdf
```

**Enumerate Objects Inside peePDF Console**

<img width="1758" height="1056" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abfd6faf-bbdc-4df0-94ca-493b38f36838" />
<img width="2068" height="1076" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e671a254-7b4e-4cef-b2c5-9e6418e6fd26" />

**Inside peePDF interactive shell:**

```bash
objects
```

**Why This Command**

* Lists all object IDs
* Identifies encoded objects
* Flags suspicious streams
* Reveals embedded files
* Shows JavaScript objects

**Analyst Interpretation**

* Presence of decode filters indicates:

  * compressed payload
  * encoded script
  * obfuscated content
  * hidden executable stream

After analyzing all samples using peePDF, the internal PDF objects were successfully enumerated and reviewed. Based on the suspicious objects identified through peePDF and PDFiD, targeted follow-up analysis was performed using pdf-parser to extract and decode the specific objects for deeper inspection.

---

**Interpretation**

Document executes code on open → no user action required.

**Conclusion**

High-risk execution behavior.

```

Interpretation: Sandbox evasion delay.

---

# Analyst Decision Log

* Encoded PDF streams detected → escalated to structural scan
* Execution triggers found → object decoding performed
* UPX sections detected → unpacked before IOC extraction
* DLL lacked entry point → executed via rundll32 install export
* Persistence suspected → registry diff performed
* Behavior unclear → CAPA capability mapping used
* Delay behavior observed → reverse engineering confirmed

---

# Adversary Tradecraft Observed

* Packing for evasion
* Service persistence
* Registry modification
* Execution delay anti-sandbox
